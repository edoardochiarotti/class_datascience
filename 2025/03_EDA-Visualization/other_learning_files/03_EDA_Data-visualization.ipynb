    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of **performing initial investigations** on the data so as to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. As we previously discussed, a Data Science project is an iterative process, so it's quite common that data cleaning and EDA happen at the same time, as one helps the other. EDA was promoted by [John Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey) to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "EDA consists of two main processes:\n",
    "- **Getting an overview of data** using summary numbers such as **descriptive statistics**,\n",
    "- **Visualizing** your variables and their relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA allows to:\n",
    "- identify data quality issues: does something look wrong? If so, you need additional cleaning!\n",
    "- select your variables:\n",
    "     - is there redundancy between our explanatory variables? If so, we might not need all of them...\n",
    "     - do we observe some association between our dependent and independent variables? Causation implies association, so if you do not find some association, you might have an issue! By the way, you probably know that correlation does not imply causation. But can you have causation without correlation? Yes, you can! For example, you might have some non-linear relation between your variables. So causation implies association, but does not imply correlation! Read the article [Association, correlation and causation](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3587) by Naomi Altman & Martin Krzywinski to learn more!\n",
    "- select your sample: e.g., is your dataset balanced (e.g., same number of observations for each unit/country/year)? If not, you may need additional cleaning... or additional data\n",
    "- prepare your data: do you need to normalize the data? Or apply some logarithmic transformation? Or another technique?\n",
    "- choose the right statistical tools / ML algorithms: it depends, among other things, on the type of your data (continuous, categorical, binary, etc.).\n",
    "- get an idea of the underlying variation: How do variables varies over time? Over space? Can you spot anomalies or interesting shocks to exploit for a natural experience?\n",
    "- ... and much more!\n",

    "We will discover in this notebook some EDA techniques. You can also always use Quentin Gallea's [recipe to empirically answer any question rapidly](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-recipe-to-empirically-answer-any-question-quickly-22e48c867dd5)."

    "In the 19th century, there was frequent large-scale epidemics of cholera in European cities. The source of the disease was not known, or misunderstood. Actually, in the world of the 1850s, cholera was believed to be spread by [*miasma*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory), i.e., some kind of air pollution. Everything changed in 1854 with an English physician, [John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow). He decided to map the cases of an epidemic in the Soho district of London. Soon, a culprit emerged: all the cases were clustered around the water pump in Broad street. John Snow's investigation demonstrated that contaminated water was the key source of the epidemics of cholera, and the removal of the handle led to cessation of the epidemic. His contribution - originating from a map - was key to promote better sanitation, and hence decrease public health issues due to waterborne diseases.\n",

Explore different combinations of variables. Explore subsets of your data. Plot many graphs without spending much time of the design (although your graph should still be understandable by you and your team). And repeat until you have a good understanding of your dataset, your variables, their evolution and patterns.\n",

Well, it's gonna be wild - and potentially confusing - with visualization libraries and packages! \n",

Hunter to design MATLAB-like plots (hence, its name), but with its continuous development it now offers much more. \n",

    "Inspired by Matplotlib, many libraries/packages were developed to introduce new features and facilitates some operations, such as [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or even [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html).\n",
    "\n",
