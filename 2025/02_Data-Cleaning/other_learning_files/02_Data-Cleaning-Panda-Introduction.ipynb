    "We have, for the same pollutants than before, their unit damage cost. The damage costs are the costs and expenses that are or would be incurred to prevent, control or abate the environmental harm caused by pollution. We notice that the costs vary per country for air pollutants (NO$_x$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$, SO$_x$, NMVOC, NH$_3$). Indeed, these pollutants induce a local pollution: they are transported in the air over relatively short distance before being inhaled by humans and contaminating soil, water, and ecosystems (at which point they could be ingested by humans). By contrast, greenhouse gases (GHG) are responsible for climate change, which is a global pollution: it does not matter where the emissions occur, all GHG emitted contribute to global warming. As for heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Hg, As, Ni, Cr), they induce a local pollution, but the available data was only for an average European damage cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that the costs are independent of years. Indeed, all the monetary data (e.g., GDP) are expressed in 2019 euros.\n",
    "\n",
    "GrDP is defined as GDP minus the external costs resulting of human activities. In its current version, the indicator only includes the external costs for which the impacts are known, measured, and priced; namely GHG, air pollutants, and heavy metals. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute GrDP, we will need to multiply the emissions data - contained in our data frame `df_clean` - by our unit cost data - included in the data frame `df_data`. It will be more convenient to operate on a single data frame. Thus, we need to merge our two data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems complex though: not only do the columns differ, but also the rows since the emissions vary for each year and the costs do not. No worries, Pandas is here to come to the rescue! There are several methods and functions to combine two data frames:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.concat()` combines data frame along an axis, either across rows or columns. \n",
    "- `.join()` combines data on key column or an index.\n",
    "- `.merge()` combines data on common columns or indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand how these methods work, I strongly recommend reading the associated [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html). You can also check this [Real Python tutorial](https://realpython.com/pandas-merge-join-and-concat/#pandas-concat-combining-data-across-rows-or-columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we want to combine our two data frames such that, for each country-year observation, we have the variables GDP, population, emissions of each pollutants, and costs of each pollutants. Our two data frames have one column in common, the country. Moreover, we want to keep all the observations from the `df_clean` data frame while the costs for a given country should be the same for each year, i.e., we need to 'copy' the information of the `df_cost` data frame. We can achieve this using the `.merge()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the column(s) on which we merge our data frames are called the keys. If you dive a bit into the `.merge()` documentation, you will notice that you have different options to deal with cases where the keys differ (e.g., suppose that we have different countries in our two data frames):\n",
    "- `inner` only keeps the rows with common keys, i.e., the intersection;\n",
    "- `outer` keeps all rows, i.e, the union;\n",
    "- `left` keeps all rows from the left (first) data frame, and disregards the ones from the right (second) data frame when the keys do not exist in the left data frame;\n",
    "- `right` keeps all rows from the right data frame, and disregards the ones from the left data frame when the keys do not exist in the right data frame;\n",
    "- `cross` creates the cartesian product of rows of both frames, i.e., it creates rows with all possible combination of keys.\n",
    "You can specify the method with `how`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, in our case, we do not need to worry about the method since the countries are the same.\n",
    "\n",
