In such situation, all individuals would be better off cooperating but fail to do so because of conflicting interests between them, which discourage joint action (see illustration below). Many environmental issues takes the form of a social dilemma. For example, recycling requires time and efforts but decreases the consumption of materials if widely adopted. Purchasing an electric vehicle is costly but reduces air pollutants, associated with various respiratory and cardio-vascular health diseases, and greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for climate change.\n",

    "We will assume that individuals have *homo moralis* preferences: they consider not only their selfish payoff but also what happens when all others do the same action. The weight of selfishness and morality depends on the individual degree of morality.

Think about climate change: the impacts are future, there are lots of uncertainties for example regarding catastrophic events (flood, drought), and many impacts are still unknown or not measured, for instance biodiversity loss.\n",

More precisely, we assumed that the implementation of financial incentives would not affect individuals' morality.

In a field-study in day-care centers, they have shown that the introduction of a fine for parents arriving late to collect their children significantly increased the number of late-coming parents. Even worse, the effect was not reversible: after the fine was removed, no reduction occurred. Similar effects have been observed for environmental policy, suggesting that putting a price on Nature can lead individuals to leave the \"moral sphere\" towards the \"economic sphere\". In our model, this implies a decrease of the degree of morality. \n",
