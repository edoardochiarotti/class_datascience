# Python Basics

Python will be the main programming language we will be using throughout this course. To review some basics about Python:
- Explore the "Python Basics" notebooks
- Practice with Python completing the exercises in the "Python practise" notebook   
- [optional] You can follow the instructions in the notebook "local_installation" to install Python on your computer. Although it will not be needed in this course, local installation is common practice for industry and research projects.
