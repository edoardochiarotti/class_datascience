For example, let's think that we are about to draw our sample of countries for which we have data on CO2 emissions per capita. We assume that there is a 95% chance that CO2 emissions per capita of the first country in our sample will be between 3 tonnes ($5-1\\times2$) and 7 tonnes ($5+1\\times2$).

    "- OK now we'll apply all these concepts and equations on real data using Python. When we did the sample-mean model, we considered CO2 emissions per capita from the QoG Environmental Indicators dataset (QoG-EI) database (exercises notebook).  We found that, on average, one person emits 5.016 tonnes of **CO2 emissions** per year. In addition, looking at the p-value of 0.00000000000038846703634227, we can say that this result is statistically significant at the 1% level (the p-value is smaller than 0.01). This means that, based on our sample and assumptions, we can be pretty sure that a person emits more than 0 tons of CO2 per year. The probability that we are wrong on this claim is 0.00000000000038846703634227 %.\n",
    "- Great. But let's say now we want more. Instead of just studying the average value of CO2 emissions per capita, now we want to understand what drives CO2 emissions per capita (on average). What could it be? For the sake of this exercise, let's pick something \"naive\". Could it be the case that the amount of **money we have** influences how much we emit? So, more in general, the research question would be: is wealth driving climate change? The mechanism would be the following: the richer we are, the more goods we consume, and the production of those goods emit CO2. So, intuitively, people with high income consume lots of carbon-intensive goods and services, i.e. they fly more, and therefore emit more.\n",
    "- How do we translate this into our model? Simple. Instead of assuming that the mean component of CO2 emissions per capita is simply $\\beta$, we'll assume that its mean component is $\\beta_0+\\beta_1x$, where $x$ is GDP per capita. In other words, we assume that, on average, CO2 emissions per capita linearly depend on the value of the GDP per capita. Or similarly, that we can use GDP per capita to predict CO2 emissions per capita."

    "- We are assuming that there is a linear relationship between the log of CO2 Emissions and the log of GDP per capita (plus some randomness), i.e. the regression model of the population is $ln\\_edgar\\_co2pc = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 ln\\_gdp\\_pc + \\epsilon$. We can use this sample to estimate the population parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$. As we have seen above, a good estimator to estimate these parameters is the OLS estimators, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals. Let's use the canned method `sm.OLS.from_formula` to get the OLS estimates for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$:"

    "- OK now that we have an understanding of what the numbers in our table are, let's interpret them. Remember that both our variables are in logs (i.e. we have a **log-log model**), so the interpretation will be in percentage points. For a summary of how to interpret coefficients with different combinations of level and logged variables check [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-interpret-linear-regression-coefficients-8f4450e38001) or [here](https://data.library.virginia.edu/interpreting-log-transformations-in-a-linear-model/).\n",
    "- The coefficient estimate for `ln_gdp_pc` of 1.3136 means that, on average, if GDP per capita increases by one percent, we'd expect CO2 emissions per capita to increase by 1.3157 percent (i.e. $(1.01^{1.3136}-1)\\times100$). Or, if we want to multiply by 10 to make it more meaningful, a 10-percent increase to GDP per capita leads CO2 emissions per capita to increase by 13.33 % (i.e. $(1.10^{1.3136}-1)\\times100$).\n",
    "- In addition, as the p-value is lower than 5%, we can infer that, based on our sample and estimate, we can be pretty sure that the population parameter's $\\beta_1$ is different than zero (the probability that we are making a mistake when making this argument is 0.000 ... etc). We can get to the same conclusion by noticing that the 95%-confidence interval of the coefficient estimate does not contain 0.\n",
    "- What if we wanted to study the effect of an increase in 1000 US dollars of GDP per capita on the tonnes of CO2 per capita, rather than a 1% or a 10% increase? Well, we'd have to estimate a **level-level model**:"

    "- So if GDP per capita increases by 1000 dollars, on average we'd expect CO2 emissions per capita to increase by approximately a quarter of a tonne (0.2385). Or in the same way, people in countries where GDP per capita is 1000 dollars higher than in other countries emit 0.2385 tonnes more than other countries.\n",
    "- Finally, we did not interpret the **intercept** as its interpretation does not have much economic sense. For example, 0.1874 means that the average CO2 emissions per capita when GDP per capita is zero is around 0.18 tonnes. However GDP per capita is never zero, and that's why the estimate of $\\beta_0$ does not have much economic sense. However, it is always good practice to include the constant in a regression model, as (i) it usually improves the estimates, (ii) otherwise we should come up with a reason of why it should not be there (which is usually hard to do), (iii) now we are fond of it as it allowed us to learn the mean model (even though now has a different meaning). Long story short, make sure you always have it."

    "- OK thank you Chris Martin, though all you are adding to our former table is just a nice sparkling way to see if results are statistically significant at the 1-percent level (3 stars 1 percent, 2 starts 5 percent, 1 star 10 percent). Why not.\n",

    "- So an **R-Squared** of 0.88 means that the fit line (or prediction) explain around 88% of the variation in our data. Indeed, you saw in the scatterplot how our fit line was nicely fitting the cloud of data points. Not bad. There isn't a right or wrong level of R-Squared, so we should always interpret it with caution. For sure, if it's like 0.00001, then that's a red flag that our OLS fit line is not doing a very good job in fitting the data."
