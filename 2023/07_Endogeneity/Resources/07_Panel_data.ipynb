    "- During last class, we have explored whether higher income leads to higher emissions, possibly through higher consumption. We have used a cross-sectional sample of 94 countries to estimate that, on average, if GDP per capita increases by 1%, we'd expect CO2 emissions per capita to increase by around 1.3245 %. This estimate comes from a specification that includes also a measure for carbon-tax revenues, as we believe that this variable can be a source of omitted-variable bias.\n",
    "- Now can our estimate still be biased? Maybe. For example, let's think about how **cultural traits** can lead people to generally pollute less. We could make the case that some countries have a culture of extending the life of products and re-use, at least more than other countries. This aspect may come from the way people in these countries prepare food, their religious beliefs, etc. As a result, people in these countries consume less in general, and therefore they may consume also less carbon-intensive goods and services. If these countries with such a cultural trait are also generally poorer (plausible), then we might be overestimating the impact of income on emissions. Indeed, we might be seeing a huge difference in CO2 emissions between poor and rich countries mainly because rich countries have no culture for recycling and re-using. So it is not because I am rich that I pollute more, but it is because of my culture. If I were poor, I'd still pollute a lot.\n",
    "- So how can we disentangle the impact of income per se and culture on emissions? Cultural aspects are generally unobservable, so we can't simply find a variable (observable) that controls for them. What we can do is using panel data and include countries' fixed effects.\n",
    "- Let us re-write the model for the data generating process with 2 regressors in a **panel-data setup with fixed effects**, for $i=1,...,N$ and $t=1,...,T$:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",

This new term is what is usually refer to as fixed effects. The important point is that we cannot observe them, so we can't just control for them by including them in our regression, as we did for $x_{2,it}$. So how do we do?\n",
    "- The trick is that, rather than having 1 variable for $u_i$ with data on a specific (unobservable) aspect, we can include N **country dummies** which equal 1 for a given country and zero otherwise, and which capture any specific characteristic of a specific country."

Remember that the mean of $\\boldsymbol{y}$ is the coefficient estimate related a vector of ones (mean model). So the mean of $\\boldsymbol{y}$ in country 1 will be the coefficient estimate related to a vector that equals 1 for country 1 and 0 otherwise.
