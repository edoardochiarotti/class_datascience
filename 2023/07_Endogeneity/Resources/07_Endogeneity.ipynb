    "- In the previous class we considered the assumptions of the linear regression model for the OLS to be a good estimator, namely:\n",
    "    1. **Linearity**: $\\boldsymbol{y} = \\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$\n",
    "    2. **Full rank**: $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is full rank, i.e. there is no exact linear relationship among any of the independent variables in the model.\n",
    "    3. **Exogeneity of the independent variable**: $ \\mathrm{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}|\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{0}$. This implies $\\mathrm{E}(\\boldsymbol{y}|\\boldsymbol{X}) = \\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$.\n",
    "    4. **Homoscedasticity and nonautocorrelation**: $\\mathrm{V} (\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}|\\boldsymbol{X})=\\sigma^2\\boldsymbol{I}_N$. If we consider assumption 3, this assumption can be re-written as $\\mathrm{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}'\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}|\\boldsymbol{X}) = \\sigma^2\\boldsymbol{I}_N$.\n",
    "    5. **Data generation**: $\\boldsymbol{X}$ may be fixed or random.\n",
    "    6. **Normal distribution**: $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}|\\boldsymbol{X}$ is normally distributed.\n",
    "- In econometrics, instead of saying good we say \"**unbiased**\", i.e. the mean of the estimator is the parameter of interest. Also, under assumption 4 (that is usually referred to as \"spherical disturbances\"), we say that the OLS estimator is also the most **efficient among** all estimators, i.e. it has the smaller variance. Formally this implication is called the **Gauss-Markov theorem**, i.e. under assumptions 1-6 the OLS estimator is the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE).\n",
    "- These implied properties of the OLS estimator (unbiased and efficient) are usually referred to as the **small-sample properties** of the OLS estimator. On that basis, econometrics then uses **asymptotic theory** to extend such properties to large sample. In a nutshell, when the sample size is large, we need less-stringent assumptions than 1-6 to claim that the OLS is consistent (which is the large-sample version of unbiased). For example, in large samples we only need a weak endogeneity of the independent variables, expressed as $\\mathrm{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\boldsymbol{X})$ (rather than $\\mathrm{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}|\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{0}$)), for the estimator to the consistent.\n",
    "- The exogeneity assumption is by far the most important one. Whenever it fails, i.e. whenever some of the regressors are correlated with the error term, the OLS estimator is **biased** (or inconsistent in large samples). The problem comes from the fact that the OLS estimator assigns to some of the regressors the effect of changes in the error terms which are correlated with these regressors. This can arise for several reasons, namely omitted variables, simultaneity / reverse causality, error-in-variables / measurement error, and sample selection. \n",
    "- Let's discuss the bias arising from **omitted variables**. A common failure of the assumption on the exogeneity of the independent variable is when a relevant variable is omitted. We can illustrate the bias that it might cause using the simple regression model. Assume that the model of the data generating process (and also of the population), has 2 regressors:\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{E}(\\hat{\\beta}_{1,OLS}) = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_{1i}-\\overline{x})x_{2i}}{(x_{1i}-\\overline{x})^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- Omitting the variable $x_2$ therefore leaves the estimate of the coefficient $\\beta_1$ unbiased if either of the two following **conditions** are satisfied: \n",
    "    - the partial effect of $x_2$ is zero in the sample, i.e. the estimate of $\\beta_2$ is not statistically different from zero (which means it that the model omitting $x_2$ is actually well specified); \n",
    "    - $x_1$ and $x_2$ are uncorrelated in the sample, i.e. the factor after $\\beta_2$ in the equation is zero (you should have noticed that that factor would be the coefficient estimate of a regression of $x_2$ on $x_1$).\n",
    "- As soon as $x_2$ has some effect on the dependent variable and is correlated with $x_1$ to some extent, there will be an omitted variable bias. It is therefore important, when thinking about potential omitted variable, to try to determine whether they are likely to be correlated with the included regressors. Omitting a variable which is uncorrelated with the regressors is not a problem. After all, there will always be some of such variables in the error term.\n",
    "- When $\\mathrm{E}(\\hat{\\beta}_{1,OLS}) > \\beta_1$ we say that there is **upward bias** (the coefficient is “too high”). When $\\mathrm{E}(\\hat{\\beta}_{1,OLS}) < \\beta_1$ we say that there is a **downward bias**. Intuition should allow you to determine whether the coefficients are biased upward or downward. For example, let's consider our analysis of the income, proxied by GDP per capita, on CO2 emissions per capita. In our analysis, the coefficient estimate of 1.3136 tells us that, on average, if GDP per capita increases by 1%, we'd expect CO2 emissions per capita to increase by 1.3136%. Let's think of a omitted variable that would make this estimate biased. Maybe **carbon taxes**? If countries with high income per capita also have high carbon tax, then individuals are somehow constrained in the amount of environmentally-damaging goods they can buy. Without any carbon tax, they would buy even more of these goods, and thus emit even more. So, if we do not control for carbon taxes, i.e. if we do not keep them constant, we might be underestimating the real effect of income on climate change (downward bias). Let's analyze in order our 2 conditions to see if a tax on carbon could be an omitted variable here:\n",
    "    - Correlation between carbon taxes ($x_2$) and GDP per capita ($x_1)$: it could be that countries with higher GDP per capita could also have higher carbon taxes, as the institutions in those countries are \"more developed\" and therefore have already implemented high carbon taxes to fight climate change.\n",
    "    - Correlation between carbon taxes ($x_2$) and CO2 emissions per capita ($y$): it could be that higher carbon taxes lead to less emissions because with a carbon tax either people or firms consume less environmentally-intensive goods (like oil etc)."

First of all, the coefficient estimate of **GDP per capita** indeed increased from 1.3136 to 1.3245 - and looking at the p-value we can infer that the population parameter is different from zero, and that the probability that we are being wrong when making this claim (inference) is lower than 1%. From now on, we can summarize all this by saying that results are statistically significant at the 1-% level. Second, the coefficient of the **revenues from carbon-related taxes** is indeed negative, indicating that countries with higher tax rates on carbon have lower emissions. However, the p-value of this coefficient estimate is 0.273, which means that this result is not statistically significant even at the 10-% level. In short, based on our sample, we cannot say that the effect of carbon-related taxes on CO2 emissions per capita is different than zero.\n",

As the R-Squared by construction increases as we add regressors, the **adjusted R-Squared** does not (for more information, see Green). So as also the adjusted R-Squared increases marginally, we can say that this small increase reflects an actual improvement in the fit of the model, and not the fact that we have added another regressor. Finally the **F statistic** is a test statistic for the joint significance of the regressors. As we included carbon-related taxes, this t-statistic largely decreased.

    "- **Simultaneity / reverse causality**. The omitted variable case is not the only one: the error term can be correlated with the regressors when there is reverse causality (or simultaneity), i.e. whenever the dependent variable has a direct effect on the regressors. Imagine for instance that you want to test the effect of financial development on economic growth. There might be a reverse causality problem, as economic growth positively affects demand for credit and the size of the financial system. This causes correlation between the error term and the regressors: when the error term increases, it will increase financial development.\n",

Imagine that instead of $x$, you observe $\\breve{x} = x + \\epsilon$: the regressor is observed with error. Assume that this error is uncorrelated with $x$, $y$ and $v$: $\\mathrm{E}(ve)=\\mathrm{E}(xe)=\\mathrm{E}(ye)=0$. This is a very common problem, and is called classical measurement error. We can rewrite our model as $y = \\beta(\\breve{x}-\\epsilon)+v=\\beta \\breve{x}+(v-\\beta\\epsilon)$. Part of the error term now contains $\\epsilon$: as $\\breve{x}$ and $\\epsilon$ are positively correlated, the OLS estimation will generate a negative bias in $\\hat{\\beta}$ if the true $\\beta$ is positive, and a positive bias if the true $\\beta$ is negative.

We did it because we believe that countries with high GDP per capita might also have higher carbon taxes, and if we do not control for the latter we might be underestimating our coefficient of interest, as with high taxes individuals are not free to consume as much as they wanted to. By including carbon-related taxes in our model, we were able to estimate the effect of GDP per capita on CO2 emissions per capita by keeping carbon-related taxes constant. We have seen that results do not change much.\n",
    "- Let us now ask ourselves a slightly different question. Do we have reasons to believe that the effect of GDP per capita on CO2 emissions might change as carbon-related taxes increase? Maybe. Indeed, to motivate the direction of the potential bias, we said that without any carbon tax people might buy even more carbon-intensive goods, and thus emit even more. So what we are saying is that **our channel might be even stronger** in countries with low carbon taxes, with respect to others.\n",
    "- Note that here our logic is slightly different than the one we used to think about omitted-variable bias. Indeed, the source of omitted-variable bias had to meet 2 conditions, i.e. (i) $x_2$ is correlated to $x_1$, (ii) $x_2$ itself explains $y$. Now, we are thinking about an $x_2$ that meets 2 slightly different conditions, i.e (i) $x_2$ is correlated to $x_1$, (ii) the interaction between $x_2$ and $x_1$ explains $y$. I am saying this because even if a variable is not necessarily a source of omitted-variable bias, its interaction with another regressor may still help explaining the variation of our dependent variable, so we still may want to model such interaction. This links to what our own Quentin did in his article in Towards Data Science. When we thought about rain as a possible source of heterogeneity, he did not worry about whether rain itself explained the stringency of environmental regulations. Differently, what he thought is that maybe the fact that heat waves make policy makers more aware of climate change (and therefore they make laws about it) is even more straightforward in countries where it does not rain, regardless of whether rain itself can change the opinion of policymakers about climate change. Cool.\n",

Then, $\\beta_1$ now is the impact of carbon taxes on CO2 emissions per capita when GDP per capita is zero, which does not have much economic sense as there are no countries where GDP per capita is actually zero dollars.

    "- Our expectations have been met!! First, the coefficient estimate for `ln_gdp_pc` of 1.5127 indicates that a one-% increase in GDP per capita leads CO2 emissions per capita to increase by 1.5127% when the revenues from carbon taxes are zero (larger than the 1.314% impact found before).

Second, the coefficient estimate for the interaction between GDP per capita and carbon-tax revenues (`ln_gdp_pc:oecd_cctr_gdp`) of -0.0024 tells us that the impact of GDP per capita on CO2 emissions is, on average, 0.0024 percentage points lower as our index for carbon-tax revenues increase by one unit. However, the p-value of 0.155 tells us that this result is not statistically significant at the 10-% level.

    "- Nice table!! And indeed we get slightly stronger results for our interaction term in column 3, which is now statistically significant at the 5-% level.\n",
    "- You can take this table as a rule of thumb to present your results with interaction terms. You should always show (i) your baseline specification (column 1), your baseline specification augmented with the added variable of interest (column 2), your baseline specification augmented with your added variable and the interaction term of interest (column 3). You should comment these columns step by step, and saying whether your coefficient estimates are in line with your logic and expectations, and if not come up with explanations of why that might be the case.\n",
    "- So let's **interpret this table** by relying on the reasoning explained above. The table above reports regression results for the relationship between GDP per capita, expressed in thousands of US dollars per year, and CO2 emissions per capita, expressed in tonnes of CO2 per year, obtained with a cross-sectional sample of 94 countries. **Column 1** reports the baseline results. The coefficient estimate of 0.239 indicates that, on average, if GDP per capita increases by 1000 US dollars, we'd expect CO2 emissions per capita to increase by 0.239 tonnes. This result is statistically significant at the 1-% level. Looking at the Adjusted R-Squared, we can say that GDP per capita explains around 64% of the variation of CO2 emissions per capita, which is quite high. These results could be subject to omitted-variable bias, as countries with higher GDP per capita might also have higher carbon taxes, which in turn affect CO2 emissions. As with a carbon tax individuals consume less carbon-intensive goods than what they would normally do, we expect that our result of column 1 underestimates the real effect (we have a downward bias). We control for this issue with the specification of **column 2**, in which we include a dummy that equals one for countries above the median of an index for carbon-tax revenues, and 0 otherwise. The negative and statistically significant coefficient estimate of -0.953 suggest that indeed countries with higher carbon-tax revenues have lower emissions. This in turn hints that carbon-tax revenues can be a source of endogeneity in our sample. In addition, as the coefficient estimate of GDP per capita moves from 0.239 in column 1 to 0.242 in column 2, we indeed confirm that in column 1 we might have underestimated the effect. Furthermore, the high value for the F statistic suggests that the estimates for both regressors in our model are jointly significant. So the less-biased specification of column 2 suggest that, on average, if GDP per capita increases by 1000 US dollars, we'd expect CO2 emissions per capita to increase by 0.242 tonnes.\n",
    "- We'll leave it as an exercise for you to comment column 3."
