    "\n",
    "*How do sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies affect fishing ground biocapacity?*\n",
    "\n",
    "We could think that SST anomalies is reducing the biosphere's ability to produce seafood. Indeed, since most marine animals live in the upper layers of the water body, excess temperature could diminish the livability of these layers, forcing fishes to migrate, for example, to deeper zones, in turn affecting their ability to reproduce because:\n",
    "- eggs may properly develop only at given temperature,\n",
    "- changes in natural characteristics (e.g., terrain) may make breeding impossible, \n",
    "- changes in local food chain could make breeding more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, a high fish consumption could exert additional pressure on the biosphere, while more stringent environmental regulation could lower this pressure. Hence we should also consider these factors in our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is our assumption correct? Let's explore! \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the variables that we selected to answer our research question:\n",
    "- **outcome variable**: Fishing ground biocapacity per capita (ef_fg_bc), which is the ability of a biosphere to produce seafood (the amount of fishing grounds available, weighted by the productivity of fishing grounds) per capita;\n",
    "- **main explanatory variable**: SST anomalies (ohi_csst), which is the number of positive temperature deviations (anomalies) that exceed the natural range of variation for a given location, i.e., the frequency with which a location experiences unnaturally warm temperature;\n",
    "- **additional explanatory variable**: Fish footprint of consumption (gha per person) (ef_fg), calculated based on estimates of the maximum sustainable catch for a variety of fish species.\n",
    "- **additional explanatory variable**:  Number of climate change laws and policies (ccl_nlp), which is the cumulative sum of laws (legislative acts) and policies (executive provisions) related to climate change\n",

Indeed, richer countries may have both a greater fish consumption and stricter environmental norms protecting fishing biocapacity (what we observe in our scatter plot).
