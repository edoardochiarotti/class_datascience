In the mean model of the population, we assume that this probability distribution is normal with mean $\\beta$ and variance $\\sigma^2$. For example, the distribution of CO2 emissions per capita of all countries can be represented by a normal distribution with mean, say, 5 tonnes per capita (or more generally $\\beta$) and variance, say, 1 tonne per capita (or more generally $\\sigma^2$).

For example, let's think that we are about to draw our sample of countries for which we have data on CO2 emissions per capita. We assume that there is a 95% chance that CO2 emissions per capita of the first country in our sample will be between 3 tonnes ($5-1\\times2$) and 7 tonnes ($5+1\\times2$). In other words, we assume that the DGP for the first country follows the distribution of the population, i.e. a normal distribution with mean 5 (or more generally $\\beta$) and variance 1 (or more generally $\\sigma^2$). \n",

Specifically, always defining $\\boldsymbol{x}=(1, ..., 1)'$, we have seen that we can estimate $\\beta$ with the sample-mean estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_{SM} = (\\boldsymbol{x}'\\boldsymbol{x})^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{x}'\\boldsymbol{y}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\beta,\\sigma^2(\\boldsymbol{x}'\\boldsymbol{x})^{-1})$, which gives sample-mean predictions $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}_{SM}=\\boldsymbol{x}\\hat{\\beta}_{SM}$ and sample-mean residuals $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{SM}=\\boldsymbol{y} - \\boldsymbol{x}\\hat{\\beta}_{SM}$. Furthermore, $\\sigma^2$ can be estimated with the sample-variance estimator $\\hat{\\sigma}^2_{SV} = \\frac{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{SM}\\,'\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{SM}}{N-1}$ with $\\frac{N-1}{\\sigma^2}\\hat{\\sigma}^2_{SV} \\sim \\mathcal{\\chi}^2_{N-1}$.

So, more in general, the research question would be: is wealth driving climate change? The mechanism would be the following: the richer we are, the more goods we consume, and the production of those goods emit CO2. So, intuitively, people with high income consume lots of carbon-intensive goods and services, i.e. they fly more, and therefore emit more.\n",

Instead of assuming that the mean component of CO2 emissions per capita is simply $\\beta$, we'll assume that its mean component is $\\beta_0+\\beta_1x$, where $x$ is GDP per capita. In other words, we assume that, on average, CO2 emissions per capita linearly depend on the value of the GDP per capita.

    "- OK thank you Chris Martin, though all you are adding to our former table is just a nice sparkling way to see if results are statistically significant at the 1-percent level (3 stars 1 percent, 2 starts 5 percent, 1 star 10 percent). Why not.\n",
    "- Finally also note that this table shows R-squared and Adjusted R-squared. We did not do the adjusted yet (and rightfully so as they are the same in our case). But we can interpret the R-squared. As seen above:\n",

    "$R^2=\\frac{ESS}{TSS}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\\hat{y}_{i,OLS}-\\overline{y})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_{i,OLS}-\\overline{y})^2}=1-\\frac{SSR}{TSS}=1-\\frac{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{OLS}\\,'\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}_{OLS}}{TSS}$\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- So an **R-Squared** of 0.88 means that the fit line (or prediction) explain around 88% of the variation in our data. Indeed, you saw in the scatterplot how our fit line was nicely fitting the cloud of data points. Not bad. There isn't a right or wrong level of R-Squared, so we should always interpret it with caution. For sure, if it's like 0.00001, then that's a red flag that our OLS fit line is not doing a very good job in fitting the data."
