    "- The shape of density functions depends on quantitative measures that are called **\"moments\"**. In mathematics, the moments of a function are quantitative measures related to the shape of the function's graph. If the function is a probability distribution, then the first moment is the expected value, the second central moment is the variance, the third standardized moment is the skewness, and the fourth standardized moment is the kurtosis ([Wikipedia, Moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics))).\n",

    "- Let's define the **expected value**, i.e. the first moment. Intuitively, the expected value of a discrete random variable is a weighted average of all possible outcomes, where the weights are the probabilities that these outcomes materialize (given by the probability mass function). In the case of a continuum random variable, the expectation is defined by integration ([Wikipedia, Expected Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value#Random_variables_with_density)).

The variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its first moment ([Wikipedia, Variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance)). Intuitively, the variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. The notation for the variance of a random variable $y$ is $V(y)$. The general formula for the variance of a continuous random variable is:\n",

This example shows that the shape of the density function, and therefore the probability distribution, depends on its variance. \n",

    "- Assume that you want to study the characteristics of the individuals of a population (individuals are not necessarily human beings, they can be firms, countries, sectors, ...). **Sampling** is the only way to do so if the population is large, as observing the entire population is typically impossible. For instance, we want to study the CO2 emission per capita of the population of swiss students. However, we do not have data for all the active students in Switzerland, so let's say we will have to work only with a sample of students (e.g. this class).\n",
    "- Statisticians operationalize the concept of a **“population”** in terms of mathematical objects that they know how to work with, i.e. probability distributions. In other words, we, novel statisticians, will **model** the population as a probability distribution.\n",
    "- For example, the distribution of CO2 emissions per capita of the active students in Switzerland can be represented by a normal distribution with mean, say, 5 tonnes per capita (or more generally $\\beta$) and variance, say, 2 tonnes per capita (or more generally $\\sigma^2$). In concise notation, this **population model** can be written as follows:\n",

Before even asking you guys how much are your CO2 emissions and obtain our sample, we want to say something about the properties of such sample. Let's then refer to a hypothetical sample (not filled with data yet!) as the **random sample**:\n",

So each observation in the random sample is a random variable that follows the distribution of the population.\n",
    "- For example, let's think that we are about to draw our sample of students for which we have data on CO2 emissions per capita. We assume that there is a 95% chance that CO2 emissions per capita of the first hypothetical student in our sample (first observation) will be between 1 tonne ($5-2\\times2$) and 9 tonnes ($5+2\\times2$). In other words, we assume that the generating process of the data for the first hypothetical student follows the distribution of the population, i.e. a normal distribution with mean 5 (or more generally $\\beta$) and variance 2 (or more generally $\\sigma^2$). We do the same for the second hypothetical student (second observation in the random sample), the third hypothetical student (third observation in the random sample) ... and the same for the Nth hypothetical student (Nth observation in the random sample).\n",
    "- Formally, we can express this concept as the **model of the DGP**:\n",

    "- Now we know the properties of our random sample, which will be useful to describe estimators. As we are happy with all these properties, let's now think of the moment when we go out there, we get the data on CO2 emission per capita and we obtain our **sample**, which is just one realization of the random sample:\n",
