We have often performed operations on single elements of our object, e.g., adding a new key to our dictionary or replacing a value. What if we want to repeat the same operations? One way would be to repeat the same lines of code over and over again... That is very inefficient, for example imagine you have a list containing one thousand elements and you want to perform the same operation on each of them, that would be one thoudand lines of code!

It turns out that the arguments of the `range()` function work much like indexing. If you have a single argument, you get that many integers, starting at 0 and incrementing by one. If you give two arguments, you start inclusively at the first and increment by one ending exclusively at the second argument. Finally, you can specify a stride with the third argument.\n",

For every element of our range (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`), we assessed whether the condition `benefit*kappa_list[i] >= cost*(1-kappa_list[i])` was `True`. As we have seen before, `kappa_list[i]` extracts the element of the list `kappa_list` located at index `i`.

    "Let's take a minute to understand what is happening in a `while` loop. The value of `k` is changing with each iteration, being incremented by `0.01`. Each time we consider doing another iteration, the condition is checked: is the social benefit weighted by the degree of morality strictly lower than the individual cost weighted by the degree of selfishness? If yes, i.e., the condition is evaluated to `True`, then the iteration continues. In other words, iteration continues in a `while` loop until the condition returns `False`.\n",

    "We have to be extra cautious when using `while` loop. If the condition is always `True`, then the condition can never returns `False`. We are thus stuck in an **infinite loop** and the code runs forever! If this happen, you can interrupt the kernel to stop the endless calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Better, do not be stuck in infinite loop! For example, you can first check the condition with a few values before writing the while loop to make sure it can returns `False`. Also check that your incrementation is working as expected outside of the loop. You can add a second condition, one that will for sure returns `False` after a given number of iterations. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cost = 1            # individual cost \n",
    "benefit = 3         # social benefit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize sequence index\n",
    "k = 0               # degree of morality\n",
    "i = 0               # iteration\n",
    "max_it = 1000       # maximum number of iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "# condition for cooperation: \n",
    "# social benefit times k is greater than individual cost times (1-k)\n",
    "while benefit*k < cost*(1-k) and i < max_it:\n",
    "    k+=0.01\n",
    "    i+=1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, `i` keeps track of the number of iteration and `max_it` defines a maximum number of iteration (1000). We added the condition `i < max_it`. This condition will for sure returns `False` if we reach 1000 iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, another way to avoid infinite loop is to use the `break` statement that we will discover below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may wonder, when to use `for` loop and when to use `while` loop? In most cases, you could use one or the other. Here is a general rule:\n",
    "- If you know how many times you have to do something (or if your program knows), use a `for` loop. \n",
    "- If you don't know how many times the loop needs to run until you run it, use a `while` loop. "
