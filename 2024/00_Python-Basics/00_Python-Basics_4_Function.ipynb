    "As always, let's take an example. We will use the [Cobb-Douglas production function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb%E2%80%93Douglas_production_function), which models the relationship between production output and production inputs (factors). It was put forward by mathematician Charles Cobb and economist Paul Douglas between 1927 and 1947 (Cobb & Douglas, 1928). They studied the relative importance of the two input factors, labor and capital, in manufacturing output in the USA over the period 1899 to 1922. Their model was the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y = A L^{\\alpha} K^{1-\\alpha} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $Y$ is the output, $A$ is the efficiency parameter, $L$ labor, $K$ capital, and $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ is the output-elasticity of labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cobb and Douglas estimated the parameters using standard econometrics tools. They found $\\alpha = 0.75$, implying that labor accounted for three quarters of the value of US manufacturing output (capital accounting for the remaining quarter) over the period studied. For the efficiency parameter, they got $A=1.01$, which, since it is greater than 1, reflects the positive effects of unobservable forces on production through the combination of labor and capital. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: Cobb, C. W., & Douglas, P. H. (1928). A theory of production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical form that we used, with $\\alpha + (1-\\alpha)=1$ implies constant return to scale: output increases by the same proportional change as all inputs change. In addition, the cross-partial derivative of production output $Y$ with respect to labor $L$ and capital $K$ is positive and the second-order partial derivatives are both negative (because $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$). It means that adding either more labor or more capital (but not both) to the production process increases output, though at a diminishing rate. Finally, because $\\alpha$ is a constant, it implies that the shares of labor and capital are constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "The design of the Cobb-Douglas production function was influenced by statistical evidence: it appeared that labor and capital shares of total output were constant over time in developed countries. However, Cobb and Douglas themselves acknowledged that their production function does not rest on solid theoretical foundations, nor should it be understood as a law of production! Still, nowadays, the Cobb-Douglas production function is often used in economics models. The main reason: its simple mathematical properties are attractive, in the sense that it is relatively easy to derive analytical solutions using such function. Obviously, this is very questionable. Many other models were developed to remedy the shortcomings of Cobb-Douglas, which will be discussion for your economics courses...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the lesson though: **always question the assumptions behind models**, both theoretical and empirical. Do the assumptions have a large influence on the results? Can you back up the assumptions with data or theory? Also remember, even unrealistic assumption (e.g., *homo oeconomicus*) can lead to interesting results. A model is like a map. For example, think about a metro map: such map represents the metro lines and their connections, but is obviously not a faithful representation of reality! Still, it is very convenient to find your way from one place to another. What matters here is the goal. You would not use your metro map to walk from one station to another. Similarly, with economic/statistical models, ask yourself the question: **Can we extrapolate?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, enough discussion of the history of economics and economic models, and back to Python. Let's implement our Cobb-Douglas production function!"
